This project is about pharmaceutical categorisation, and I classified the given data to forecast the type of liver illness.
This file contains a detailed explanation of how to execute eda, model building, model evaluation, and other related tasks. 
To select the best model, I tested different types of supervised models, including logistic, KNN, SVM, decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBOOST. Among these, 
I chose XGBOOST since it has the highest accuracy score. After finalising the model, I deployed it using the Streamlit app. You can anticipate the type of liver disease
that will occur in the future by entering all of the necessary sugar and blood levels. 
It indicates the type of category to which it belongs as well as the probability.
